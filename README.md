Example Unity App using Heyzap Ads
=================

This project contains the [Unity StarTrooper sample project](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/8566), modified to include Heyzap Ads. To run the app, open `Assets/StarTrooper.unity` then build and run (targetting iOS).

The app repurposes the *shoot missile* button to show a Heyzap Ad. All code using the Heyzap Ads SDK is located in `PlayerControls.js`
